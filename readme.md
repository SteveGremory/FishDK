# The FishDK Programming Language
The FishDK Programming language aims to be opinionated and based. That's about it, leave you suggestions and bugs in the GitHub issues and please follow the code style if you want to contribute to the project.

# Compiler
The compiler will be written in C++ using the LLVM toolchain until the language has been bootstrapped.
